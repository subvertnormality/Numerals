## Roman Numerals

View the application running at http://quiet-beach-8520.herokuapp.com/ .

The tests are written in PHPUnit and can be run in the usual manner. The application code is independent of Laravel, and is hooked up inside a Laravel controller. Laravel essentially provides an API which the javascript client interacts with.

### Things that could be improved given more time

* Core mode
* Acceptance tests/tests for laravel controllers
* Client side javascript testing
* More validators/parsers/generators for different types of numerals (Attic numerals, Etruscan numerals etc).
